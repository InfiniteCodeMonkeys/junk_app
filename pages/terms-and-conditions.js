              interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado,
              without regard to its choice of law provisions, as though all acts
              and omissions occurred in the State of Colorado. The parties shall
              submit all disputes, claims or demands of any kind relating to or
              arising out of these Terms (“Controversy”) to a three-step dispute
              resolution process. The three-step process shall (i) begin with
              informal negotiation conducted in good faith; (ii) be followed, if
              necessary, by mediation exclusively in Denver, CO, initiated by a
              written demand of one party served on the other, and if the
              mediator determines that the Controversy cannot be resolved by
              mediation or if either party shall make a written demand therefor,
              then; (iii) the Controversy shall be submitted to binding
              arbitration exclusively in Denver, CO, conducted by a neutral
              arbitrator, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
              American Arbitration Association. The arbitration award shall
              include attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to this Agreement, and
              any damages or remedies otherwise available under applicable law,
              shall be supported by written conclusions of law and fact.
              Application may be had by any party to any court of general
              jurisdiction for entry of judgment based on the arbitration award.
              The foregoing notwithstanding, either party may maintain, for the
              purpose of obtaining a provisional remedy or provisional relief,
              any underlying action or claim on which such affirmative relief
              may be based.

              complying, either totally or in part, with any of the terms or
              provisions of these Terms by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike,

              regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement of any governmental
              authority, riot, war, rebellion or other causes beyond the
              reasonable control of Junk Drawr, or other acts of God, then upon
              written notice to Customer, the affected provisions and/or other
              requirements of these Terms shall be suspended during the period
              of such disability and Junk Drawr shall have no liability to
              Customer in connection therewith. Junk Drawr shall use reasonable
              efforts to remove the disability within thirty (30) calendar days
              of giving notice of the disability.

              amendment, or modification is in writing signed by the party
              against whom enforcement is sought. Representations or statements
              made by any employee, agent, or representative of Junk Drawr shall
              not be binding on Junk Drawr unless agreed upon in writing by Junk
              Drawr.
